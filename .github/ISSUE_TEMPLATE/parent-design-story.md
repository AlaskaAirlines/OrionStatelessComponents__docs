# User story

As a designer, I want a standard UI and symbol for this component, so I can easily replicate in my designs.

## Outline subtasks or tasks

> List specific steps required to deliver this work.

- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

## Definition of “Done” (exit criteria)

> The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.

- [ ] Backlogged
- [ ] Discovery
- [ ] Design
- [ ] [Review](must link to child story)
- [ ] [Production]
- [ ] [Symbolizing](must link to child story)
- [ ] Complete
