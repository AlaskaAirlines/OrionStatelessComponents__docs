# User story

As a UI designer of Auro, I want to be able to review the work, so I can give feedback and prepare for next steps.

## Outline tasks

> List specific steps required to deliver this work.

- [ ] Update status labels: remove `backlogged` and add `work in progress
- [ ] Update kanban status: move from `Backlog` to `Current WIP Release`

- [ ] review work as presented by the product designer
- [ ] provide feedback
- [ ] prepare for next steps of development and symbolize
- [ ] Add a link to Abstract in story comments

## Definition of “Done” (exit criteria)

> The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.

This story will be considered done when the presented work has been approved and prepared for dev work and symbolization.
