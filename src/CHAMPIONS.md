# Auro Champion

Auro is an Open Source Software solution to the problem of building a design system. What that means is, like so many other OSS projects in the world, Auro is a small team and we need designers and developers to be actively involved for it to grow and become the cross-team resource we all hope it can be.

In response to this, we on the Auro Team, in partnership with Alaska Airlines software development teams, have created the Auro Team of Champions. A group of volunteers who are excited about the idea of having a Design System and platform-agnostic toolset from which to build new experiences for our customers.

## What is an Auro Champion?

Simply put, an Auro Champion is a proponent of the Auro Design System and an advocate for its use within any development team.

## What does a Champion do?

Auro Champions are the eyes and ears that can help better inform the core Auro Team as to the needs and concerns of the individual product teams.

Getting issues in Github when something is broken or missing is one thing, but getting to understand the ins and outs of daily development is essential to the growth and greater adoption of the Auro Design System. Auro Champions provide that 2-way communication so desperately needed to make a project like this succeed.

## What is needed to be an Auro Champion?

First and foremost, you need to be passionate about creating uniform front-end software. You must be opinionated when it comes to providing the best experience possible for Alaska's customers. And most of all, you must be open-minded and willing to look at solving problems from multiple points of view. This is essential as there are many aspects to building a Design System that may have wildly different impacts on the individual product teams.

Other than that, a Github account really helps too.

## What is expected of a Champion?

Outside of your passion for this problem, not much else will be asked of you. The group will meet every so often, but for the most part, what we desire the most is your feedback. This can come in the form of direct communication, starting a thread on Github, or a general all-hands meeting.

Contributing actual work is not a requirement. But if you see an opportunity to add value to the Auro project, we, by all means, encourage you to do so!
