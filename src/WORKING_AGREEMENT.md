# Design System working agreement 

The purpose of this document is to illustrate the process from which new components may be added to the design system. 

## Acceptance criteria

For any submission to the design system to be accepted, this contribution must meet a very specific set of criteria, that includes, but not limited to: 


#### Design Criteria 

1. Does not replicate any existing design or functionality 
1. Must denote support for mobile and desktop experiences 
1. If applicable, a native (iOS/Android) counterpart should be identified 
1. All interactions are defined and documented
1. All specifications of design are documented 
1. Must meet all accessibility standards
1. Has been tested/validated/approved by peers and subject to external testing if applicable 
1. Contingencies are supported if applicable 
1. Any content has been approved
1. Engineering has been consulted prior to any peer review submission 
1. Work has been approved by peer review on new feature branch

#### Engineering Criteria

1. Must meet all specifications as set by design submission
1. Must meet mobile-first support criteria 
1. All applicable design elements must use approved design tokens 
1. Must meet all accessibility standards 
1. Any content structure must meet all SEO specifications 
1. All functionality must meet minimal automated testing standards
1. All supporting documentation must be submitted with new work
1. If applicable, full API must be documented 
1. If applicable, a full demonstrative version of new work must be added to the supporting documentation web site
1. Design has been consulted prior to any peer review submission
1. Work has been approved by peer review on new feature branch


## Submission workflow

Design and engineering work are not independent cycles. It will be considered non-compliant if one part of the process is committed and released before its complimentary submission. 

This workflow intends that neither designers nor engineers will have access to any new submission until all parts have been completed and approved and are ready for consumption by the organization as a whole. 

### Identify problem to be solved

Prior to any work submission, the work must meet a basic criteria to assure that the effort is warranted and will be accepted into the design system. 

1. Problem is not already solved by other means of existing functionality and/or design
1. Problem must be a valid use case across multiple projects and experiences
1. Proposed solution to problem does not cause side-effects on any pre-existing scenarios

### Work submission process 

The following is a baseline for a work submission process to ensure that the proposed work is compliant with all the standards as stated prior. 

1. Problem identified and proposed solution as been accepted 
1. Initial design work meets all previously stated criteria 
1. Engineering has been consulted for feedback prior to handoff 
1. Approved design work is communicated to engineering 
1. Initial engineering work meets all previously stated criteria
1. Engineering reviews all work with design 

### Approval for distribution 

It is only once design and engineering have completed all the steps as outlined above and ensures that all design, documentation, feature(s) and functionality meet the defined specification, that either the design or engineering work will be merged into master branches and distributed for use across the organization. 

Any outliers to this process will constitute non-compliant actions and any distributed work will be reverted and removed from general distribution.
