# Accessibility and testing

Development of components require fine attention to details for conforming to accessibility regulations. For more information on how to best use Aria rules, please be sure to review this document by the [Google Chrome team](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools/wiki/Audit-Rules).

### Google Chrome Inspector

Built within Google's Chrome inspector is an **audit** tab that will run the Lighthouse performance tool. Uncheck all the audits except for **Accessbility**, choose either Desktop or Mobile and run the audit. Lighthouse will return a detailed report about the accessibility performance of the component.

Also within Google's Chrome inspector is the **Accessibility** tab. This view will give individual results on the accessibility of the element you have selected.

### AXE

A Chrome extension that is highly recommended to install is the [AXE Accessibility Testing Tool](https://www.deque.com/axe/).

Install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US).
