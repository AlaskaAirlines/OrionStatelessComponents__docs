# Parent story

The role of the parent story is to be the over-all process manager of the work. This story will have the baseline specification definition as well as a checklist of deliverables. 

## Assignees 

The primary designer working on this story and the reviewing UI designer will both be assigned to this story to ensure a quality deliverable. 

## Labels 

Please be sure to address the following label expectations for story management. 

1. Project. Please be sure to assign the proper Epic project if applicable
1. Status. Either `Backlogged`, `Work In Progress` or `Complete / Ready to Merge`
1. Type. For these stories, please use `Design`

Please see **Managing labels** below for more details regarding the use of Github labels. 

## Example

```
# User story

As a [persona], I want to be able to [intent, not feature(s)], so I can [describe benefit].

## Outline subtasks or tasks

> List specific steps required to deliver this work.

- [ ] ... 
- [ ] ...

## Definition of “Done” (exit criteria)

> The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.

- [ ] Backlogged
- [ ] Discovery
- [ ] Design
- [ ] Review [story]()
- [ ] Production
- [ ] Symbolizing [story]()
- [ ] Complete 

## Audit

[link to parent audit if applicable]
```

Github's markdown supports a `checkbox` feature where users of the stories can checkoff items as they are completed. 

The REVIEW and SYMBOLIZING stories will have links to their respective child story. 

## Expectations

The expectation of this type of story is that assignees will check-off the items in the lists as they are completed. 

When the story is actively being worked on, an assignee is responsible for updating the label to `Status: Work In Progress` and please make sure that the story is in the `Current WIP Release` kanban column. Both these actions can be managed via the controls on the story page itself. 

## Handoff for review

When the primary designer is ready to start the review process, this action will be initiated and managed via Abstract. The parent story will remain in progress. 

## Closing the story

This story cannot be closed until all the child stories have been completed. Please see CLOSING STORIES below for specific information.
