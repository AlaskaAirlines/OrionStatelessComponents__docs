# Symbolizing story

The role of the symbolizing story is to assign the responsibility of symbolizing the newly designed asset into the Auro UI Kit. The process for doing and approving the work will happen in the Abstract environment, but please ensure that this story is managed appropriately for clear communication as to the status of the work. 

## Assignees

This story will be individually assigned to the designer completing this work. 

## Labels

Please be sure to address the following label expectations for story management. 

1. Project. Please be sure to assign the proper Epic project if applicable
1. Status. Either `Backlogged`, `Work In Progress` or `Complete / Ready to Merge`
1. Type. For these stories, please use `Design`

Please see [Managing labels](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/handoff/labels) for more details regarding the use of Github labels. 

## Example 

```
# User story

As a designer, I want to be able to have access to a symbolized version, so I can easily reuse with my project.

## Outline subtasks or tasks

> List specific steps required to deliver this work.

- [ ] Add completed work to UI Kit as Sketch Symbol

## Definition of “Done” (exit criteria)

> The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.

- [ ] the documented design spec has been created
- [ ] assets have been symbolized in the UI toolkit
- [ ] new UI has been applied to the WC

## Expectations

The expectation of this type of story is that assignee will check-off the items in the lists as they are completed. 

When the story is actively being worked on, an assignee is responsible for updating the label to `Status: Work In Progress` and please make sure that the story is in the `Current WIP Release` kanban column. Both these actions can be managed via the controls on the story page itself. 

## Closing the story

Please see [Closing stories](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/handoff/close) for specific information.
