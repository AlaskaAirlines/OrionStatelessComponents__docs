# User story

As a designer, I want to be able to have access to a symbolized version, so I can easily reuse with my project.

## Outline subtasks or tasks

> List specific steps required to deliver this work.

- [ ] Add completed work to UI Kit as Sketch Symbol

## Definition of “Done” (exit criteria)

> The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.

## Expectations

The expectation of this type of story is that assignee will check-off the items in the lists as they are completed. 

When the story is actively being worked on, an assignee is responsible for updating the label to `Status: Work In Progress` and please make sure that the story is in the `Current WIP Release` kanban column. Both these actions can be managed via the controls on the story page itself. 

## Closing the story

Please see CLOSING STORIES below for specific information.
