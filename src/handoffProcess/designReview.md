The review process itself will be managed via Abstract tooling.

# User story

As a UI designer of Auro, I want to be able to review the work, so I can give feedback and prepare for next steps.

## Outline subtasks or tasks

> List specific steps required to deliver this work.

- [ ] review work as presented by the product designer
- [ ] provide feedback
- [ ] prepare for next steps of development and symbolize

## Definition of “Done” (exit criteria)

> The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.

This story will be considered done when the presented work has been approved and prepared for dev work and symbolization.

## Expectations

The expectations of this type of story is that the assignee will check-off the items in the lists as they are completed.

When the story is actively being worked on, the assignee is responsible for updating the label to `Status: Work In Progress`. Please make sure that the story is in the `Current WIP Release` kanban column. Both these actions can be managed via the controls on the story page itself.

It is important that these expectations are meet as they are essential to the clear communication of the work status.
