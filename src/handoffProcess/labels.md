# Managing labels

Using status labels in Github is an efficient way to clearly communicate the status of any work. The Auro Design System also uses these labels to communicate what stories are backlogged, in progress or complete in various dashboards. Keeping these labels current is paramount to ensuring that the dashboards are always showing correct information.

### Backlogged

The status of `backlogged` will be added to every story by default as every story is initially backlogged until it is selected for work.

### Work in progress

Once a story is selected for work, please address the following steps:

1. Remove the backlogged status
1. Add the `Work In Progress` status label
1. Move the issue from **Backlog** to **Current WIP Release**
