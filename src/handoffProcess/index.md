# Auro Design to Dev process

The following flow is intended to create a repeatable process for Alaska designers follow when creating or updating design assets that need to be coded into the Auro web component system as well as added-to or update existing sketch symbols. 

## Github stories

The following types of stories will be created to assist with this process. Definitions and expectations will follow. 

1. Parent story
1. Design review story
1. Symbolizing story
1. Development story

## Managing labels 

Using status labels in Github is an efficient way to clearly communicate the status of any work. The Auro Design System also uses these labels to communicate what stories are backlogged, in progress or complete in various dashboards. Keeping these labels current is paramount to ensuring that the dashboards are always showing correct information. 

### Backlogged

The status of backlogged will be added to every story by default as every story is initially backlogged until it is selected for work. 

### Work in progress

Once a story is selected for work, please address the following steps: 

1. Remove the backlogged status 
1. Add the `Work In Progress` status label
1. Move the issue from **Backlog** to **Current WIP Release**

## Closing stories 

Once a story/issue is completed, please address the following steps on Github. 

1. Ensure that all applicable checkboxes are checked
1. Add any comment info that is applicable as to the status of the delivery 
1. Add label `Status: Complete / Ready to Merge`
1. Remove label `Status: Work In Progress`
1. Add a closing comment of completed work
1. Click `Close Issue` - this action will automatically move the story out of the WIP workflow column
