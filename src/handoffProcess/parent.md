# Parent story

The role of the parent story is to be the over-all process manager of the work. This story will have the baseline specification definition as well as a checklist of deliverables. 

Note in the checklist there are two steps that will have links associated to them. These steps are linked to individual stories that are to be assigned and managed throughout this process. 

## Assignees 

The primary designer working on this story and the reviewing UI designer will both be assigned to this story to ensure a quality deliverable. 

## Labels 

Please be sure to address the following label expectations for story management. 

1. **Project** Please be sure to assign the proper Epic project if applicable
1. **Status** Either `Backlogged`, `Work In Progress` or `Complete / Ready to Merge` should be applied at any given time to clearly communicate status.
1. **Type** For these stories, please use `Design`

Please see [Managing labels](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/handoff/labels) for more details regarding the use of Github labels. 

## Example

```
# User story

As a [persona], I want to be able to [intent, not feature(s)], so I can [describe benefit].

## Outline subtasks or tasks

- [ ] ...

## Audit

```

Github's markdown supports a `checkbox` feature where users of the stories can checkoff items as they are completed. 

The REVIEW and SYMBOLIZING stories will have links to their respective child story. 

## Expectations

The expectations of this type of story is that the assignees will check-off the items in the lists as they are completed. 

When the story is actively being worked on, an assignee is responsible for updating the label to `Status: Work In Progress`. Please make sure that the story is in the `Current WIP Release` kanban column. Both these actions can be managed via the controls on the story page itself. 

It is important that these expectations are meet as they are essential to the clear communication of the work status. 

## Handoff for review

When the primary designer is ready to start the review process, this action will be initiated and managed via Abstract. The parent story will remain in progress. 

## Closing the story
