# Using Github labels

Labels associated with **Issues** and **Pull Requests** are an essential part of communicating the status of the work in progress.

Please be sure to review all the [labels per project](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/auro_docs/labels). All the repositories per the Auro Design System are kept in identical sync.

## When to use labels

The following guide is a description of the process of managing issues and pull requests within each repo.

It is expected that all who touch an issue or a pull request do their part to ensure that the correct labels are associated with the task or pull request.

### Generic labels

Labels such as `duplicate` or `help wanted` are general indicators that can be applied at any time in the work item's lifecycle.

### Priority:

Not all stories come with a desired priority and one does not need to be set with each issue.

Priorities are mainly used for issues as this communicates the expectations for completed work. Pull requests hardly require this label as there is always a priority to review and close pull requests as soon as possible.

### Status:

Status labels are probably the most important labels that can be used. They communicate the state in which the work is in. Without them being used correctly, the state of work will always require research and that can be very time-consuming.

If the use of a status requires feedback, please be sure to add a comment to the issue or pull request and specifically mention the team member you wish to hear from.

If the status is time-specific, as in `help wanted` or `blocked`, please be sure to remove this label once the issue has been resolved.

#### Issue statuses

The following are good status types to use for issues.

* Status: Approved for work (approved to be worked on)
* Status: Proposal (idea or suggestion)
* Status: Work In Progress (add when work has started)
* Status: PR Welcome (asking for help to solve)

#### Pull request statuses

The following is a list of status types to use with pull requests

* Status: Work In Progress (add when work as started)
* Status: Review Needed (requesting PR feedback)
* Status: Complete / Ready to Merge†† (when work is considered completed by the submitter)

†† The status of `Status: Complete / Ready to Merge` is NOT an indicator that the PR is closed and should be merged. The purpose of this status is to announce that the dev who submitted the PR considered this work complete and 'ready to merge'.

All PRs require official APPROVAL before merging.

### Type:

The use of type labels is to help others get a glance to see what type of work is being done. This will also help produce reports later as well.

Please be sure to review all the type options so that they are used correctly.

Every issue and pull request should have a Type label.

### Sizing

The use of Sizing labels helps other quickly see what the perceived effort for delivering a work item is. The sizing model used with Auro could be described as a variation on the T-Shirt sizing model. Sizes fall within the scale of SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE and X-LARGE.

* Small: Easily delivered work, low risk, low effort
* Medium: Delivery requires attention, medium risk on delivery
* Large: This is a sizable load of work to deliver and tough to break up. Risk is not equated to volume
* X-Large: Woah! Really? This is too large to deliver in a single PR and is super risky!

When a task is labeled with `X-Large` this is considered a RED FLAG and the request MUST be broken into smaller chunks of work that can be individually reviewed if not individually delivered.

#### Type: High Risk

Risk is not always associated to size. For example, a task my have a very low amount of work to be done, but this work, when released, carries a high risk of potential issues.

In these cases where a task is considered more risky than others, please add this label.
