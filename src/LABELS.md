# Using Github labels

Lables associated to Issues and Pull Requests are an essential part of communicating the status of the work in progress.

Please be sure to review all the [labels per projects](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/auro_docs/labels). All the repositories per the Auro Design System are kept in identical sync.

## When to use lables

The following guide is a description as to the process of managing issues and pull requests within each repo.

It is expected that all who touch an issue or a pull request do their part to ensure that the correct labels are associated to the task or pull request. 

### Generic labels

Labels such as `dupicate` or `help wanted` are general indicators that can be appled at any time in the work item's lifecycle.

### Is there a priority for the ISSUE?

Not all stories come with a desired priority and one does not need to be set with each ISSUE. 

Priorities are mainly used for ISSUES as this is a communication as to the expectations for the completed work. Pull requests hardly require this label as there is always a priority to review and close Pull Requests as soon as possible. 

### Status messages

These are probably the most important labels that can be used. They clearly communicate the state in which the work is in. Without them and without them being used correctly, the state of work will always require research and that cam be very time consuming. 

If the use of a status required feedback, please be sure to add a comment to the issue or pull request and specifically mention the team member you wish to hear from. 

If the status is time specific, as in `help wanted`, `need more info` or `blocked`, please be sure to remove this label once the issue has been resolved. 

### Type

The use of type labels really help others at a quick glance see what type of work is being done. This will also help produce reports later as well. 

Please be sure to review all the type options so that they are used correctly.
