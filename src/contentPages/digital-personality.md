# Digital personality

## Overview

Our digital brand colors are complemented by an additional set of colors informed by both physical and digital expressions. This allows designers to define hierarchy, highlight content, and better guide our guests.

Complementary colors provide us with greater range and flexibility to scale our brand. Complementary color usage can vary depending on need, but they should be considered when you want a conversational tone in an interaction.
