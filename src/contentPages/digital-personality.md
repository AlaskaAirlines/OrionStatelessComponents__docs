# Digital personality

## Overview

Our digital brand colors are complemented by an additional set of colors informed by both physical and digital expressions. This allows designers to define hierarchy, highlight content, and better guide our guests.

Complementary colors provide us with greater range and flexibility to scale our brand. Complementary color usage can vary depending on need, but they should be considered when you want a conversational tone in an interaction.

## Color in action

Following are examples of how our digital personality palette might be used across products and devices. A cohesive balance of transactional and conversational tones ensures impactful and intentional usage.

### Interface accents

When conversational tones are introduced as interface accents, they support core UI elements in deepening hierarchy and highlighting content.

## Transactional colors

We use our transactional colors to move guests through task-based interactions.

### Midnight

Midnight reinforces our confident tone and builds off of our wordmark color. This color is most effective in situations that call for being bold and brand-forward.

Use Midnight sparingly. Refer to the Design Guidelines section for more information on using Midnight.

### Atlas

Use Atlas for interactions on a light background. Don't use Atlas for non-interactive elements: this can dilute the experience and cause confusion for guests.

### Breeze

Use Breeze for interactions on a dark background. Don't use Breeze for non-interactive elements: this can dilute the experience and cause confusion for guests.

### Tropical
Tropical enhances our interface with a vibrant, electric tone analogous to our blue hues. This tone should be used only to compliment or highlight other content.

## Conversational colors

Our conversational colors add warmth and energy to our experience. Each color evokes or elicits a specific emotion.
Use these colors sparingly, and only when they support and reinforce the content and intended function.

### Alpine

Alpine carries a tone of friendly sophistication.

### Goldcoast

Goldcoast inspires joy. It is a way to capture the fun of travel in our interfaces. Use Goldcoast to highlight content that might otherwise be lost on the page. Most complimentary to our blue hues, consider Goldcoast to add depth and contrast.
