# Using Github Project

All Auro project work in Github is managed via [Github Projects](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1). Any work addressed outside the scope of this project is propritary Alaska Airlines business.

## Work starts as a new issue

All ne work comning into the Auro Github repositories starts as an issue assigned to a specific repository. If the issue does not have a repository home, then it is suggested that the issue be assigned to the [auro_docs](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/auro_docs/issues) repository.

Within each repository, when creating a new issue please be sure to choose the correct Issue type.

## New issues

When new issues are created, please be sure to assign the issue to the the [Auro project](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1) for management.

New issues will be added to the [Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1#column-7174329) column. When creating a new issue, please be sure to append the correct [labels](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/auro_docs/blob/master/src/LABELS.md) to ensure that the status of the issue is being clearly communicated.

## Reported bugs

Any new issue with the `Type: Bug` label will be transferred over to the [Reported bugs](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1#column-7985331) column and be given higher priority. 

## Issue assignment 

As issues make their way to prioritization, they will either be assigned to the next team sprint or to a non-core team member. 

Issues assigned to non-team members will be added to the [Issues assigned to non-core member(s)](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1#column-8075570) column for visibility. 

All issues that are slotted to be worked on in an upcoming sprint will be added to the [current sprint](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1#column-8320945) column. 

Issues will remain in their respective columns until they are closed or a pull request associated to this issue is close. 

## Pull Requests

As new pull requests are created and associated to the Auro project, they will automatically appear in the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1#column-8320727) column. 

Be sure that when a new pull request is crated that, as with issues, are labeled correctly. This is essential again for quick visibility of status and reporting later on.

### Requested changes

During the lifecycle of a pull request, reviewers may ask for changes. When this happens, the pull request card will automatically be moved to the [PR w/requested changes](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1#column-8320773) column. There is no label for this status change. The request for change will notify the intended developer and the column status will clearly denote state of the pull request. 

### Ready to merge

When a pull request has been approved, this status change to the pull request will automatically move the pull request to the [Approved PRs (ready to merge)](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1#column-7174330) column. 

The `Status: Ready to merge` label is not intended to communicate this state. The use of that label is for the developer to communicate that their work is done and they consider it ready to merge. 

The automatic movement of the pull request to the Approved PR column is the visual indicator to the project manager that the work is completed and ready to be closed out. 

## Closing of issues and PRs

When a pull request is completed, post merge the PR will be closed. All issues that have been associated to this PR will also be closed noting the closing PR. 

The goal is that at the end of any given release cycle the [Release](https://github.com/orgs/AlaskaAirlines/projects/1#column-8320945) column should be empty.
