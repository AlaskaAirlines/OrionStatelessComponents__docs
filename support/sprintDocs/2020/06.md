# Rolling quarterly goals

## Questions:

1. __What's the number of completed components by the end of Sprint 11?__
    1. Design and dev will happen in rolling sprints, meaning the design of a component will happen in a sprint and the dev work would happen in the following sprint.
    1. Given this workflow and current velocity it is estimated that by the end of Sprint 11 we will have added 4 additional components, with the 5th in design and the 6th being selected.
1. __What is the state that we can expect the Doc Site to be in by the end of Sprint 11?__
    1. The current goal sets to deprecate the Gitbook site by the end of Sprint 7. With each new component, the doc site will grow. Adding a page to the doc site is part of each new WC deliverable.
    1. Updating the IA and design of the doc site has the following dependencies
        1. The doc site uses Auro to document Auro. So, the doc site cannot use design or layout principals until these are defined in Auro.
        1. The doc site will require a dedicated resource
        1. The doc site will require support from content editors

## Auro Champions "MVP of the Sprint!"

The Auro Champion MVP of the Sprint is Zach Newton from the Retain product group.

Seeing an opportunity to help the Content Editors he helps support, he took it upon himself to come up with a solution that allowed the editors to consume Auro components in their environment.

This is huge because this helped open doors for any and all users within the Alaska Air Group, and those who are not, who are creating views and are unable to use a build process with their stack. This means 3rd party vendors, blog editors and anyone who is working with simple HTML/CSS/JS environments.
